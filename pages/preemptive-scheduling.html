  <h1>Preemptive Scheduling in Go</h1>
  <p>
    Preemptive scheduling is a model where the runtime or operating system
    forcibly interrupts a running thread or goroutine to give other tasks a
    chance to execute. Unlike Go's default cooperative scheduling—where
    goroutines voluntarily yield control—preemptive scheduling doesn't rely on
    the task's willingness to pause.
  </p>

  <p>
    Historically, Go leaned heavily on cooperative scheduling, but since Go
    1.14, the runtime introduced limited preemption to handle edge cases like
    CPU-bound goroutines that don't yield naturally. Let’s dive into how
    preemptive scheduling works, explore its mechanics with examples, and
    contrast it with cooperative scheduling through interactive exercises.
  </p>

  <h2>How Preemptive Scheduling Works</h2>
  <p>
    In preemptive scheduling, the Go runtime monitors goroutines and interrupts
    them at "safe points" (e.g., loop boundaries or function calls) if they run
    too long without yielding. This ensures fairness, preventing a single
    goroutine from monopolizing the CPU.
  </p>
  <p>
    The scheduler uses signals (like <span class="code-inline">SIGURG</span> on
    Unix systems) to preempt goroutines, pausing them and switching to another
    from the run queue. This contrasts with cooperative scheduling, where
    goroutines must hit yield points like channel operations or
    <span class="code-inline">runtime.Gosched().</span>
  </p>
  <p>
    Preemption adds a small overhead—context switches are still faster than OS
    threads (nanoseconds vs. microseconds)—but it's a trade-off for better
    concurrency in CPU-intensive scenarios. Let's explore key aspects with code
    examples and exercises.

    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Forced Interruption at Safe Points</span>
        <p>
          The runtime can interrupt a goroutine during a long-running
          computation, but only at designated safe points where the stack is in
          a consistent state (e.g., after a function call or loop iteration).
          This avoids the complexity of full OS-level preemption while ensuring
          fairness.

            Before Go 1.14, <span class="code-inline">busyLoop</span> might
            delay <span class="code-inline">polite</span> significantly because
            it lacks yield points. With preemption (Go 1.14+), the runtime
            interrupts <span class="code-inline">busyLoop</span> at safe points
            (loop boundaries), allowing
            <span class="code-inline">polite</span> to print its messages
            sooner.
          </p>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Runtime-Driven Fairness</span>
        <p>
          Preemption ensures no single goroutine starves others, even without
          explicit cooperation. The runtime tracks execution time and preempts
          long-running goroutines, placing them back in the run queue.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Overhead of Preemption</span>
        <p>
          Preemption introduces slight overhead compared to cooperative
          scheduling due to signal handling and stack checks.This overhead is
          necessary for fairness. The runtime aims to keep this overhead low to
          maintain Go's performance. However, it's still lightweight compared to
          OS thread switches.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Contrast with Cooperative Scheduling</span>
        <p>
          Preemption shines where cooperation fails—tight loops with no I/O or
          function calls. Cooperative scheduling relies on goroutines yielding
          voluntarily, while preemption forces the issue.

        Preemptive scheduling in Go (since 1.14) complements cooperative
        scheduling by forcibly interrupting CPU-bound goroutines at safe points,
        ensuring fairness without heavy reliance on voluntary yields. It
        introduces minimal overhead—still far lighter than OS thread
        preemption—while enabling robust concurrency for diverse workloads. Key
        moments include loop boundaries, function calls, and runtime-driven
        interrupts via signals.

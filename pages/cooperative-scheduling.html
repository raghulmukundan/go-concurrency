  <h1>Cooperative Scheduling in Go</h1>
  <p>
    Goroutines in Go rely on a cooperative scheduling model, a cornerstone of
    their execution efficiency. Unlike preemptive scheduling, where the
    operating system forcibly interrupts threads, cooperative scheduling means a
    goroutine keeps running until it voluntarily yields control to the
    scheduler. This cooperation keeps context switching lightweight—often just
    hundreds of nanoseconds compared to microseconds for OS threads.
  </p>
  <p>
    Yield points are built into the runtime and occur naturally at specific
    moments in your code, allowing the scheduler to pause one goroutine and run
    another. Let's explore the key places where this happens, with examples and
    exercises to bring it to life.
  </p>
  <h2>Key Yield Points</h2>
  <h3>Function Calls</h3>
  <p>
    The Go compiler inserts scheduler checks at select function call boundaries,
    such as non-inlined calls. When a goroutine calls a function, the runtime
    might decide it's a good time to pause it and switch to another runnable
    goroutine. Not every call yields—optimizations like inlining can skip
    this—but it's a common point where cooperation happens.

  <div class="observation-section">
    <div class="observation-header">
      <i class="fa-solid fa-eye"></i>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      "Main runs!" often prints first because
      <span class="code-inline">sayHi()</span> gives the scheduler a chance to
      switch.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Blocking Operations</h3>
  <p>
    Operations that inherently block—like reading from or writing to a channel
    (<span class="code-inline"><-ch</span>), locking a mutex, or calling
    <span class="code-inline">time.Sleep()</span>—cause the goroutine to yield.
    When a goroutine can't proceed (e.g., waiting for a channel receiver), the
    runtime detects this and schedules another runnable goroutine. This includes
    network calls or file I/O, which block on underlying system operations.
  </p>

      id="channel-yield"
      class="code-container"
      data-code-path="cooperative-scheduling/channel-yield.go"
    ></div>
  </div>
  <div class="observation-section">
    <div class="observation-header">
      <i class="fa-solid fa-eye"></i>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="characteristics">
      <ul>
        <li>
          <span class="key-term">Cooperative Scheduling Point #1:</span> The
          sender goroutine yields control to the scheduler because it’s blocked
          on the channel send. This is cooperative because sender voluntarily
          pauses, waiting for a receiver.
        </li>
        <li>
          <span class="key-term">Cooperative Scheduling Point #2:</span> Before
          the transfer completes, receiver was technically blocked at
          <span class="code-inline"><-ch</span>, yielding to the scheduler until
          sender was ready. Once both are at the channel operation, the
          scheduler coordinates their rendezvous.
        </li>
      </ul>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Explicit Yielding</h3>
  <p>
    You can manually tell a goroutine to yield by calling
    <span class="code-inline">runtime.Gosched()</span>. It's like saying, "I'm
    stepping aside—let someone else run!" The goroutine isn't blocked or asleep;
    it's placed back in the runnable queue to wait its turn.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
    <div
      id="explicit-yield"
      class="code-container"
      data-code-path="cooperative-scheduling/explicit-yield.go"

  </div>
  <div class="observation-section">

      <i class="fa-solid fa-eye"></i>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      Output might interleave (e.g., "Routine: 0", "Loop: 0") due to yielding.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Garbage Collection</h3>
  <p>
    During garbage collection (GC), the runtime may pause goroutines at existing
    safe points—like function calls—to coordinate memory management. This isn't
    a direct cooperative yield by the goroutine itself; it's a runtime assist.
  </p>
  <p>
    Since Go 1.5, GC runs concurrently, and preemption (see below) helps, but GC
    doesn't create new yield points beyond what's already there.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
    <div
      id="explicit-yield"
      class="code-container"
      data-code-path="cooperative-scheduling/garbage-collection.go"
    ></div>
  </div>
  <div class="observation-section">
    <div class="observation-header">
      <i class="fa-solid fa-eye"></i>
      <h4>Observation</h4>
    </div>
    <p>
      GC might pause allocate at a function call, but it's not guaranteed to
      yield in a tight loop.
    </p>
  </div>
  <h3>Preemption Exception</h3>
  <p>
    While cooperative scheduling relies on natural yield points, since Go 1.14,
    asynchronous preemption can interrupt CPU-bound goroutines at safe points
    (e.g., loop boundaries or function calls). This isn't pure cooperation—it's
    the runtime stepping in to prevent long-running computations from starving
    others. It ensures fairness without the overhead of full OS preemption.

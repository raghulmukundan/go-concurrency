  <h1>Concurrency Vs Parallelism</h1>
  <p>
    Concurrency and parallelism are two fundamental concepts in computer
    science, especially when dealing with tasks that can be executed
    simultaneously. While they are related, they are not the same. Letâ€™s break
    them down and explore their key differences with examples.
  </p>
  <h2>Concurrency</h2>
  <p>
    Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same
    time. It allows different parts of a program to be executed out of order or
    in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. Concurrency is
    achieved by interleaving the execution of tasks, often using techniques like
    multitasking, multithreading, or asynchronous programming.
  </p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <h2>Key Characteristics of Concurrency:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Task Interleaving:</span> Tasks are broken into
        smaller chunks, and the system switches between them.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Non-deterministic Order:</span> The order of
        execution is not guaranteed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Resource Sharing:</span> Tasks share resources
        (e.g., CPU, memory) and may need synchronization.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Focus on Responsiveness:</span> Concurrency is
        often used to improve the responsiveness of a system (e.g., handling
        multiple user requests in a web server).
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <h2>Example of Concurrency:</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are cooking dinner:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You start boiling water for pasta.</li>
      <li>While the water is heating up, you chop vegetables.</li>
      <li>When the water boils, you add the pasta.</li>
      <li>While the pasta cooks, you prepare the sauce.</li>
    </ul>
    Here, you are not doing everything at the exact same time, but you are
    managing multiple tasks by switching between them. This is concurrency.
  </div>
  <h2>Parallelism</h2>
  <p>
    Parallelism is about executing multiple tasks simultaneously. It requires
    multiple processing units (e.g., multiple CPU cores) and focuses on
    improving performance by dividing work across these units.
  </p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <h2>Key Characteristics of Parallelism:</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Simultaneous Execution:</span> Tasks are executed
        at the same time.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Deterministic Order:</span> Tasks can be executed
        in a predictable order if needed.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Independent Execution:</span> Tasks often run
        independently without needing to share resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Focus on Speed:</span> Parallelism is used to
        speed up computation by dividing work across multiple processors.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <h2>Example of Parallelism:</h2>
    <p>Imagine you are cooking dinner with a friend:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>You boil water for pasta while your friend chops vegetables.</li>
      <li>
        Both tasks are happening simultaneously, speeding up the cooking
        process.
      </li>
    </ul>
    Here, the tasks are being executed at the same time, which is parallelism.

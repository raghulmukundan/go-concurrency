  <h1>Concurrency Vs Parallelism</h1>
  <p>
    Concurrency and parallelism are two fundamental concepts in computer
    science, especially when dealing with tasks that can be executed
    simultaneously. While they are related, they are not the same. Let’s break
    them down and explore their key differences with examples.
  </p>
  <h2>Concurrency</h2>
  <p>
    Concurrency is the ability of a system to handle multiple tasks at the same
    time. It allows different parts of a program to be executed out of order or
    in partial order, without affecting the final outcome. Concurrency is
    achieved by interleaving the execution of tasks, often using techniques like
    multitasking, multithreading, or asynchronous programming.

  <h3>Key Characteristics of Concurrency:</h3>
  <ul>
    <li><b>Task Interleaving:</b> Tasks are broken into smaller chunks, and the system switches between them.

    </li>
  </ul>

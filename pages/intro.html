    <h1>Introduction to Go Concurrency</h1>
    <p>Welcome to my collection of notes on Go concurrency! This website documents my learning journey through Go's powerful concurrency features.</p>
    <p>Go's approach to concurrency is unique and powerful, making it easier to write programs that get the most out of multicore and networked machines.</p>
    
    <h2>Key Concepts</h2>
    <p>Go's concurrency model is built on three main concepts:</p>
    <ul>
        <li>Goroutines - lightweight threads managed by Go runtime</li>
        <li>Channels - communication pipes between goroutines</li>
        <li>Select - control structure for handling multiple channel operations</li>
    </ul>

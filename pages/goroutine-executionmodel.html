  <h2>Introduction to Goroutine Scheduling</h2>
  <p>
    When you launch a goroutine with the
    <span class="go-keyword">go</span> keyword, you're creating a lightweight
    unit of execution. But how does the Go runtime decide when each goroutine
    gets to run? This is where Go's scheduling model comes in.

      What Happens Behind the Scenes?
      <div class="thought-exercise-questions">
        Consider what might happen if you run 10,000 goroutines but only have 8
        CPU cores. How might Go handle this situation? Think about this before
        continuing.

  <h2>Cooperative vs. Preemptive Scheduling</h2>
  <p>
    Goroutine scheduling has evolved over time, combining two primary
    approaches:
  </p>
  <h3>Cooperative Scheduling</h3>
  <p>
    In cooperative scheduling, a goroutine runs until it voluntarily yields
    control. Think of it as polite conversation - you speak until you decide to
    let someone else talk.

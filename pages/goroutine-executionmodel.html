  <h1>Goroutine Execution Model</h1>
  <h2>Introduction to Goroutine Scheduling</h2>
  <p>
    When you launch a goroutine with the
    <span class="go-keyword">go</span> keyword, you're creating a lightweight
    unit of execution. But how does the Go runtime decide when each goroutine
    gets to run? This is where Go's scheduling model comes in.

      What Happens Behind the Scenes?

        Consider what might happen if you run 10,000 goroutines but only have 8
        CPU cores. How might Go handle this situation? Think about this before
        continuing.

  <h2>Cooperative vs. Preemptive Scheduling</h2>
  <p>
    Goroutine scheduling has evolved over time, combining two primary
    approaches:
  </p>
  <h3>Cooperative Scheduling</h3>
  <p>
    In cooperative scheduling, a goroutine runs until it voluntarily yields
    control. Think of it as polite conversation - you speak until you decide to
    let someone else talk.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
    <div
      id="goroutine-execution-model"
      class="code-container"
      data-code-path="goroutine-execution/cooperative-scheduling.go"
    ></div>

    </div>
    <div class="thought-exercise-content">
      What is <span class="code-inline">runtime.Gosched()</span> doing in the
      above code?
      <div class="thought-exercise-questions">
        The goroutine with <span class="code-inline">runtime.Gosched()</span> is
        stopping its execution and voluntarily giving away control so that other
        goroutines can run. This is cooperative scheduling in action.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>

  <h3>Preemptive Scheduling</h3>
  <p>
    With preemptive scheduling, the Go runtime can interrupt a goroutine's
    execution even if it doesn't yield. This is like a teacher calling on a
    different student even if the current one isn't finished speaking.
  </p>
  <div class="code-section" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
    <div
      id="goroutine-execution-model"
      class="code-container"
      data-code-path="goroutine-execution/preemptive-scheduling.go"
    ></div>
  </div>
  <div class="thought-exercise">
    <div class="thought-exercise-header">
      <span class="thought-exercise-icon">

    <div class="thought-exercise-content">
      Run the above code multiple times. What do you notice?
      <div class="thought-exercise-questions">
        Even without a call to
        <span class="code-inline">runtime.Gosched()</span>, the goroutine with
        the CPU bound task will yield control to other goroutines. This is
        Preemptive scheduling in action. In the above code the for loop that
        runs for 1_000_000_000 iterations is a CPU bound task.
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>Problem with pure cooperative scheduling</h3>
  <p>
    Cooperative scheduling works great when goroutines play nice and yield
    often. But what about a goroutine that doesn’t? Imagine this:
  </p>
  <div class="code-section" style="margin: 1em 0 0 0">
    <div
      id="goroutine-execution-model"
      class="code-container norun"
      data-code-path="goroutine-execution/goroutine-problem.go"
    ></div>
  </div>
  <p>
    In older versions of Go (pre-1.14), this could be a problem. If a goroutine
    enters a tight loop with no yield points—like no function calls or blocking
    operations—it could hog the runtime indefinitely. Since the scheduler relies
    on cooperation, it wouldn’t get a chance to switch to other goroutines,
    including the main one. Your program might never print "Will I ever print?"
    because the infiniteLoop goroutine never yields.
  </p>
  <h3>The Evolution of Go's Scheduling Model</h3>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <p>Go's scheduling model has evolved significantly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Go 1.0-1.1:</span> Purely cooperative scheduling
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Go 1.2-1.13:</span> Cooperative with limited
        preemption at function calls
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Go 1.14+:</span> Asynchronous preemption added
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h3>Preemption in modern Go</h3>
  <p>
    To address limitation with Cooperative scheduling, Go introduced limited
    preemption starting in Go 1.14 (and improved it in later versions). Now, the
    runtime can interrupt long-running goroutines even if they don’t yield
    voluntarily. Here’s how it works:
  </p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <p>Go's scheduling model has evolved significantly:</p>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Safe Points:</span> The compiler inserts “safe
        points” in the code—places where it’s okay to pause execution without
        breaking anything. These often align with function calls or loop
        iterations.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Signal-Based Preemption: </span> The runtime
        sends a signal to the thread running the goroutine. If the goroutine has
        been running too long (e.g., exceeding a time threshold), the runtime
        can pause it at a safe point and switch to another goroutine.
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>
    This isn’t full preemption like OS threads—it’s still lighter and more
    controlled—but it ensures that no single goroutine can starve the system.
    For example, in modern Go, the infiniteLoop example above wouldn’t
    completely block the main goroutine forever. The runtime would eventually
    preempt it.
  </p>

  <div class="characteristics">
    <h2>How Preemption Works?</h2>
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Runtime Monitoring via Sysmon:</span>
        <p>
          The Go runtime includes a system monitor thread called <i>sysmon</i>, which
          runs in the background. Sysmon periodically checks the state of
          goroutines—roughly every 10 milliseconds—looking for ones that have
          run too long without yielding. It doesn’t use a standalone timer to
          trigger preemption; instead, it’s a dynamic watchdog that decides when
          intervention is needed.
        </p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Signal-Based Preemption: </span> The runtime
        sends a signal to the thread running the goroutine. If the goroutine has
        been running too long (e.g., exceeding a time threshold), the runtime
        can pause it at a safe point and switch to another goroutine.

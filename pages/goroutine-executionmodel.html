  <h3>Introduction to Goroutine Scheduling</h3>
  <p>
    When you launch a goroutine with the
    <span class="go-keyword">go</span> keyword, you're creating a lightweight
    unit of execution. But how does the Go runtime decide when each goroutine
    gets to run? This is where Go's scheduling model comes in.

        Consider what might happen if you run 10,000 goroutines but only have 8
        CPU cores. How might Go handle this situation? Think about this before
        continuing.

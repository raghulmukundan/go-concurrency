  <h1>Why Go Was Built for Concurrency</h1>
  <p>
    Imagine you're at Google in 2007, tasked with building huge systems that
    handle millions of requests. The programming languages available then made
    this really hard. This is exactly what Rob Pike, Robert Griesemer, and Ken
    Thompson faced, which inspired them to create Go.
  </p>

  <p>
    Now, we'll look at the problems they needed to solve and how Go's design
    fixes them. This will show us why Go works so well when handling many tasks
    at the same time.

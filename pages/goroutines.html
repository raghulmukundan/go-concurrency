  <p>What Really Happens When We Type <span class="go-keyword">go</span> ?</p>

    Remember our breakfast-making program? We simply added the
    <span class="go-keyword">go</span> keyword and magic happened. But what's
    really going on under the hood? Let's peek behind the curtain!

  <h2>The Birth of a Goroutine</h2>
  <p>
    When you type <span class="go-keyword">go</span> before a function call, Go
    performs several steps:
  </p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Creates a new goroutine data structure</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allocates a small initial stack (only 2KB!)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Records information about where to start executing</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Schedules the goroutine for execution</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>What Is a Goroutine Internally?</h2>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Goroutine Structure:</span>
        <p>
          Internally, each goroutine is represented by a small runtime data
          structure (often referred to as a “g” struct). This structure
          contains:
        </p>
        <div class="characteristics">
          <ul>
            <li>
              A pointer to its stack, which starts at a very small size
              (typically 2–4KB).
            </li>
            <li>
              Information about its current state (running, waiting, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>A pointer to the function it’s running, and other metadata.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Dynamic Stack Growth:</span>
        <p>
          Unlike OS threads that come with a fixed, often large, stack size,
          goroutines start with a small stack. If a goroutine needs more space
          (for example, due to deep recursion or large local variables), the Go
          runtime automatically allocates a bigger stack and copies over the
          data.
        </p>

    </ul>

      What happens if a goroutine exceeds its initial stack space?
      <div class="thought-exercise-questions">
        The Go runtime grows its stack dynamically to accommodate the extra
        space.

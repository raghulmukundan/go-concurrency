  <p>What Really Happens When We Type <span class="go-keyword">go</span> ?</p>

    Remember our breakfast-making program? We simply added the
    <span class="go-keyword">go</span> keyword and magic happened. But what's
    really going on under the hood? Let's peek behind the curtain!

  <h2>The Birth of a Goroutine</h2>
  <p>
    When you type <span class="go-keyword">go</span> before a function call, Go
    performs several steps:
  </p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <p>Creates a new goroutine data structure</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Allocates a small initial stack (only 2KB!)</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Records information about where to start executing</p>
      </li>
      <li>
        <p>Schedules the goroutine for execution</p>
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>What Is a Goroutine Internally?</h2>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Goroutine Structure:</span>
        <p>
          Internally, each goroutine is represented by a small runtime data
          structure (often referred to as a “g” struct). This structure
          contains:
        </p>
        <div class="characteristics">
          <ul>
            <li>
              A pointer to its stack, which starts at a very small size
              (typically 2–4KB).
            </li>
            <li>
              Information about its current state (running, waiting, etc.).
            </li>
            <li>A pointer to the function it’s running, and other metadata.</li>
          </ul>
        </div>
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Dynamic Stack Growth:</span>
        <p>
          Unlike OS threads that come with a fixed, often large, stack size,
          goroutines start with a small stack. If a goroutine needs more space
          (for example, due to deep recursion or large local variables), the Go
          runtime automatically allocates a bigger stack and copies over the
          data.
        </p>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <div class="thought-exercise-content">
      What happens if a goroutine exceeds its initial stack space?
      <div class="thought-exercise-questions">
        The Go runtime grows its stack dynamically to accommodate the extra
        space.

  <p>Lets look at an example</p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <h2>Goroutine in Action</h2>

        <ul>
          <li>
            Run this program multiple times. Do you always see all the goroutine
            messages?
          </li>
          <li>
            Try adding a small sleep after checking the goroutine count. What
            changes?

          <li>
            What happens if you remove the

        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h3>The Goroutine's Memory Model</h3>
  <p>
    Each goroutine starts with a tiny 2KB stack. This is fascinating because:
  </p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>A typical thread starts with 1MB or more</li>
      <li>
        Goroutines can create thousands of stacks in the same space as a few
        threads
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <p>A simple example to demonstrate go stacks</p>
  <div class="code-section">
    <div
      id="goroutine"
      class="code-container"
      data-code-path="goroutine/gomemorymodel.go"
    ></div>
  </div>
  <div class="thought-exercise">
    <div class="thought-exercise-header">
      <span class="thought-exercise-icon">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i>
      </span>
      <h4 class="thought-exercise-title">Thought Exercise</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-exercise-content">
      If each goroutine uses a 2KB stack, and we create 100,000 goroutines, how
      much memory would we expect them to use? Now, try the same calculation
      with traditional 1MB thread stacks - see the difference?

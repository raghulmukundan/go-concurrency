  <h1>Go Concurrency vs The Rest</h1>
  <p>
    Now that we've gotten our feet wet with Go's concurrency features, let's
    understand what makes it special by comparing it with other programming
    languages. Don't worry if you're not familiar with these other languages -
    we'll use simple analogies to understand the differences! Let’s see how Go’s
    approach compares to Java, C++, Rust, and Erlang.

    Imagine running a restaurant kitchen. Different programming languages handle
    concurrent tasks (like preparing multiple orders) in different ways. Let's
    explore this through a kitchen analogy:
  </p>
  <h2>Go's Kitchen (Go's Approach)</h2>
  <p>In Go's kitchen, we have:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Goroutines:</span> These are like chefs who can
        handle multiple orders at once. They are lightweight and can be created
        easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Channels:</span> These are like the communication
        system in the kitchen. Chefs use them to share ingredients and updates
        about orders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Go Runtime:</span> This is like an efficient
        kitchen manager who helps coordinate everything
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Java's Kitchen (Java's Approach)</h2>
  <p>In Java's kitchen, we have:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Threads:</span> These are like chefs who can
        handle multiple orders, but they are heavier and require more resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Locks:</span> These are like locks on the kitchen
        doors. Chefs need to lock and unlock them to access shared ingredients,
        which can slow things down.
      </li>
      <li>Lots of rules about who can use what equipment when</li>
    </ul>

      Why is hiring a full-time chef (Java thread) more "expensive" than getting
      a part-time helper (goroutine)?

    <button class="nav-button" onclick="navigate('prev')">Previous</button>
    <button class="nav-button" onclick="navigate('next')">Next</button>

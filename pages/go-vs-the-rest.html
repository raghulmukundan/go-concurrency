  <h1>Go Concurrency vs The Rest</h1>
  <p>
    Now that we've gotten our feet wet with Go's concurrency features, let's
    understand what makes it special by comparing it with other programming
    languages. Don't worry if you're not familiar with these other languages -
    we'll use simple analogies to understand the differences! Let’s see how Go’s
    approach compares to Java, C++, Rust, and Erlang.
  </p>
  <p>
    Imagine running a restaurant kitchen. Different programming languages handle
    concurrent tasks (like preparing multiple orders) in different ways. Let's
    explore this through a kitchen analogy:
  </p>
  <h2>Go's Kitchen (Go's Approach)</h2>
  <p>In Go's kitchen, we have:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Goroutines:</span> These are like chefs who can
        handle multiple orders at once. They are lightweight and can be created
        easily.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Channels:</span> These are like the communication
        system in the kitchen. Chefs use them to share ingredients and updates
        about orders.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Go Runtime:</span> This is like an efficient
        kitchen manager who helps coordinate everything
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Java's Kitchen (Java's Approach)</h2>
  <p>In Java's kitchen, we have:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Threads:</span> These are like chefs who can
        handle multiple orders, but they are heavier and require more resources.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Locks:</span> These are like locks on the kitchen
        doors. Chefs need to lock and unlock them to access shared ingredients,
        which can slow things down.
      </li>
      <li>Lots of rules about who can use what equipment when</li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="thought-exercise">
    <div class="thought-exercise-header">
      <span class="thought-exercise-icon">
        <i class="fa-solid fa-brain"></i>
      </span>
      <h4 class="thought-exercise-title">Think about it?</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="thought-exercise-content">
      Why is hiring a full-time chef (Java thread) more "expensive" than getting
      a part-time helper (goroutine)?
      <div class="thought-exercise-questions">
        <ul>
          <li>A full-time chef needs their own complete set of equipment</li>
          <li>They need a full salary and benefits</li>
          <li>They take up more kitchen space</li>
        </ul>
      </div>
    </div>
  </div>
  <h2>C++'s Kitchen (C++ Approach)</h2>
  <p>In C++'s kitchen, we have:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Threads:</span> Similar to Java, but with more
        control over how they work. Its like Having very skilled but
        hard-to-manage chefs
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Manual Memory Management:</span> Chefs need to
        manage their own ingredients and tools, which can be tricky.
      </li>
      <li>
        More flexibility, but also more responsibility. Having lots of powerful
        tools but also more ways things can go wrong
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Rust's Kitchen (Rust's Approach)</h2>
  <p>Rust's kitchen has:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Ownership and Borrowing:</span> Chefs need to
        follow strict rules about who can use what ingredients and tools. This
        prevents mistakes but can be a bit rigid.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Concurrency:</span> Similar to Go, but with more
        rules to follow. It's like having a very organized kitchen with lots of
        safety checks.
      </li>
      <li>
        More safety, but also more rules to follow. Having lots of safety checks
        but also more ways things can go wrong
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <h2>Erlang's Kitchen (Erlang's Approach)</h2>
  <p>Erlang's kitchen is unique:</p>
  <div class="characteristics">
    <ul>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Actors:</span> Chefs are like independent actors
        who can handle their own tasks. They communicate through a
        message-passing system, similar to Go's channels.
      </li>
      <li>
        <span class="key-term">Fault Tolerance:</span> The kitchen is designed
        to keep running even if some chefs make mistakes. It's like having a
        backup plan for everything.
      </li>
      <li>
        More resilience, but also more complexity. Having lots of backup plans
        but also more ways things can go wrong
      </li>
    </ul>
  </div>
  <div class="navigation-buttons">
    <button class="nav-button" onclick="navigate('prev')">Previous</button>
    <button class="nav-button" onclick="navigate('next')">Next</button>
